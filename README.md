My first small scale project in C++




C++ is a general purpose programming language and widely used now a days for competitive programming. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc!



-----DATA ABSTRACTION ----- Data abstraction allows a program to ignore the details of how a data type is represented. Abstraction  refers to the act of representing essential features without including the background details or explanations.  



----TEMPLATE FUNCTIONS---- A function template starts with keyword template followed by template parameters inside <> which is followed by function definition.
